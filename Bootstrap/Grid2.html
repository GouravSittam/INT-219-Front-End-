            <div class="col pink">Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and
                sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system
                market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering
                (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000
                millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the
                operating system market and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition
                of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[4] followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for
                $26.2 billion in December 2016,[5] and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May
                2011.[6]</div>
